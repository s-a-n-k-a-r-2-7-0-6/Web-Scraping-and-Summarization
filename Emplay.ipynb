      "Section Summary: Alexander III of Macedon(Ancient Greek:Ἀλέξανδρος,romanized:Alexandros; 20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC), most commonly known asAlexander the Great,[c]was a king of theancient Greekkingdom ofMacedon. [d]He succeeded his fatherPhilip IIto the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20 and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthymilitary campaignthroughoutWestern Asia,Central Asia, parts ofSouth Asia, andEgypt. In 335 BC, shortly after his assumption of kingship over Macedon, hecampaigned in the Balkansand reasserted control overThraceand parts ofIllyriabefore marching on the city ofThebes, which wassubsequently destroyed in battle. Following his conquest ofAsia Minor, Alexander broke the power of Achaemenid Persia in a series of decisive battles, including those atIssusandGaugamela; he subsequently overthrewDarius IIIand conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. Alexander endeavored to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" andinvaded Indiain 326 BC, achieving an important victory overPorus, an ancient Indian king of present-dayPunjab, at theBattle of the Hydaspes. Due to the demand of his homesick troops, he eventually turned back at theBeas Riverand later died in 323 BC inBabylon, the city ofMesopotamiathat he had planned to establish as his empire's capital.Alexander's deathleft unexecuted an additional series of planned military and mercantile campaigns that would have begun with a Greek invasion ofArabia. With his death marking the start of theHellenistic period, Alexander's legacy includes thecultural diffusionandsyncretismthat his conquests engendered, such asGreco-BuddhismandHellenistic Judaism.He founded more than twenty cities, with the most prominent being the city ofAlexandriain Egypt. Alexander's settlement ofGreek colonistsand the resulting spread ofGreek cultureled to the overwhelming dominance ofHellenistic civilizationand influence as far east as theIndian subcontinent. His military achievements and unprecedented enduring successes in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselves,[f]and his tactics remain a significant subject of study inmilitary academiesworldwide. [7]Legends of Alexander's exploits coalesced into the third-centuryAlexander Romancewhich, in the premodern period, went through over one hundred recensions, translations, and derivations and was translated into almost every European vernacular and every language of the Islamic world.\n",

      "Section Summary: Alexander III was born inPella, the capital of theKingdom of Macedon,[10]on the sixth day of theancient Greek monthofHekatombaion, which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC (although the exact date is uncertain). [11][12]He was the son of the erstwhile king of Macedon,Philip II, and his fourth wife,Olympias(daughter ofNeoptolemus I, king ofEpirus). [13][g]Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander. [14] Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood. [15]According to theancient GreekbiographerPlutarch, on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread \"far and wide\" before dying away. Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with asealengraved with a lion's image. [16]Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father wasZeus. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious. [16] On the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing asiegeon the city ofPotideaon the peninsula ofChalcidice. [15] In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse,Lanike, sister of Alexander's future generalCleitus the Black. [19]When Alexander was ten years old, a trader fromThessalybrought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteentalents. Alexander, however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to tame the horse, which he eventually managed. [15]Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring: \"My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. When the animal died (because of old age, according to Plutarch, at age 30), Alexander named a city after him,Bucephala.\n",

      "Section Title: Education\n",
      "Section Summary: When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for atutor, and considered such academics asIsocratesandSpeusippus, the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of theAcademyto take up the post. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown ofStageira, which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works ofHomer, and in particular theIliad; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns. [24] In his youth, Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court, who received the protection of Philip II for several years as they opposedArtaxerxes III. [25][26][27]Among them wereArtabazos IIand his daughterBarsine, possible future mistress of Alexander, who resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC, as well asAmminapes, futuresatrapof Alexander, or a Persian nobleman namedSisines. [25][28][29][30]This gave the Macedonian court a good knowledge of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the Macedonian state. [28] Sudawrites thatAnaximenes of Lampsacuswas one of Alexander's teachers, and that Anaximenes also accompanied Alexander on his campaigns.\n",

      "Section Summary: Philip II had waged war against theThraciansto the north, which left Alexander in charge asregentandheir apparent. [15]During Philip's absence, the Thracian tribe ofMaedirevolted against Macedonia. [32] Upon Philip's return, Alexander was dispatched with a small force to subdue the revolts in southernThrace. Campaigning against the Greek city ofPerinthus, Alexander reportedly saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city ofAmphissabegan to work lands that were sacred toApollonearDelphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. While Philip was occupied in Thrace, Alexander was ordered to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. [33] Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south throughThermopylae, taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes's favour, but Athens won the contest. [34]Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on the request of theAmphictyonic League), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it. During the ensuingBattle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenianhoplitesto follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. [36] After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, devastating much of Laconia and ejecting the Spartans from various parts of it. [37]AtCorinth, Philip established a \"Hellenic Alliance\" (modelled on the oldanti-Persian allianceof theGreco-Persian Wars), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then namedHegemon(often translated as \"Supreme Commander\") of this league (known by modern scholars as theLeague of Corinth), and announced his plans to attack thePersian Empire.\n",

      "Section Title: Exile and return\n",
      "Section Summary: [41]The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half-Macedonian. [41] At the wedding of Cleopatra, whom Philip fell in love with and married, she being much too young for him, her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece. This so irritated Alexander that throwing one of the cups at his head, \"You villain,\" said he, \"what, am I then a bastard?\" Then Philip, taking Attalus's part, rose up and would have run his son through; but by good fortune for them both, either his over-hasty rage, or the wine he had drunk, made his foot slip, so that he fell down on the floor, at which Alexander reproachfully insulted him: \"See there,\" said he, \"the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, overturned in passing from one seat to another.\" [46] In the following year, the Persiansatrap(governor) ofCaria,Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother,Philip Arrhidaeus.

Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus,[53]who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to be left alive. [54]Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. [56] Alexander stopped at Thermopylae where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south toCorinth. The famousencounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynicoccurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him, the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the sunlight.

[106]The Greeks however regarded the gesture ofproskynesisas the province ofdeitiesand believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. [106]This created a problem for Alexander as to whether he had to make use of the various segments and people that had given the empire its solidity and unity for a lengthy period of time. [106]Pierre Briantexplains that Alexander realized that it was insufficient to merely exploit the internal contradictions within the imperial system as in Asia Minor, Babylonia or Egypt; he also had to (re)create a central government with or without the support of the Iranians. [106]As early as 334 BC he demonstrated awareness of this, when he challenged incumbent King Darius III \"by appropriating the main elements of the Achaemenid monarchy's ideology, particularly the theme of the king who protects the lands and the peasants\". [106]Alexander wrote a letter in 332 BC to Darius III, wherein he argued that he was worthier than Darius \"to succeed to the Achaemenid throne\". [106]However, Alexander's eventual decision to burn the Achaemenid palace atPersepolisin conjunction with the major rejection and opposition of the \"entire Persian people\" made it impracticable for him to pose himself as Darius' legitimate successor. [106]Against Bessus (Artaxerxes V) however, Briant adds, Alexander reasserted \"his claim to legitimacy as the avenger of Darius III\". [106] A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers,Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus,Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation atMaracanda(modern daySamarkandinUzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and especially of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.\n",

Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 talents in gold\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends atHund,[126]supplied their troops with provisions, and he received Alexander and his whole army in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. Subsequently, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; Taxiles contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes and was entrusted by Alexander with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death ofPhilip, son of Machatas, and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces atTriparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of theKunar Valley, the Guraeans of theGuraeus Valley, and the Assakenoi of theSwatandBuner Valleys.

For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse, they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also, the width of which, as they learned, was thirty-two furlongs [6.4 km], its depth one hundred fathoms [180 m], while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes ofmen-at-armsand horsemen and elephants. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousandwar elephants. [138] Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther, but his generalCoenuspleaded with him to change his opinion and return; the men, he said, \"longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland\". Along the way his army conquered theMalhi(in modern-dayMultan) and other Indian tribes; while besieging the Mallian citadel, Alexander suffered a near-fatal injury when an arrow penetrated his armor and entered his lung.

      "Section Title: Death and succession\n",
      "Section Summary: [151][152]There are two different versions of Alexander's death, differing slightly in details. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiralNearchusand spent the night and next day drinking withMedius of Larissa. [154]In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever, instead dying after some agony. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian andJustinall mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication,[157]while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness. [159]Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence[160]and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas,[161]Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. [162]However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander. [163][164][165]In a 2014 manuscript in the journalClinical Toxicology, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked withVeratrum album, and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in theAlexander Romance. [166]Veratrum albumpoisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned,Veratrum albumoffers the most plausible cause. [166][167]Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (modern-dayMavroneriin Arcadia, Greece) that containedcalicheamicin, a dangerous compound produced by bacteria. [173]Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.\n",

[174][175]According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\". [177] While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. [174][176]His successor,Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at leastlate antiquity.Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. [178]The 2014 discovery of anenormous tombin northern Greece, atAmphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great[179]has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. [180][181] Pompey,Julius CaesarandAugustusall visited the tomb in Alexandria where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off.Caligulawas said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. [178] The so-called \"Alexander Sarcophagus\", discovered nearSidonand now in theIstanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because itsbas-reliefsdepict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. [185][186][187]In addition, Leosthenes also likened the anarchy between the generals, after Alexander's death, to the blinded Cyclops \"who after he had lost his eye went feeling and groping about with his hands before him, not knowing where to lay them\".\n",

[155]Another theory is that his successors wilfully or erroneously misheard \"tôi Kraterôi\"—\"to Craterus\", the general leading his Macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of Macedonia. [191]Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed hissignet ringtoPerdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him. [155][189] Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male, with himself,Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between \"The Successors\" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into three stable power blocs:Ptolemaic Egypt,Seleucid Syria and East, andAntigonid Macedonia.\n",

      "Section Summary: Alexander perhaps earned the epithet \"the Great\" due to his unparalleled success as a military commander; he never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered. [199]TheMacedonian phalanx, armed with thesarissa, a spear 6 metres (20 ft) long, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and manoeuvrability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces. [199] In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. [201]Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about 3 km (1.86 mi). [202] At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. [203]At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. [202] When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, inBactriaandSogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center. [203]In India, confronted by Porus's elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.\n",

      "Section Summary: [205]Ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image; scholars today, however, find the claim dubious. [206][205]Nevertheless, Andrew Stewart highlights the fact that artistic portraits, not least because of who they are commissioned by, are always partisan, and that artistic portrayals of Alexander \"seek to legitimize him (or, by extension, his Successors), to interpret him to their audiences, to answer their critiques, and to persuade them of his greatness\", and thus should be considered within a framework of \"praise and blame\", in the same way sources such as praise poetry are. [208] Curtius Rufus, a Roman historian from the first century AD, who wrote theHistories of Alexander the Great, gives this account of Alexander sitting on the throne ofDarius III: Then Alexander seating himself on the royal throne, which was far too high for his bodily stature. [209] Both Curtius andDiodorusreport a story that whenDarius III's mother,Sisygambis, first met Alexander andHephaestion, she assumed that the latter was Alexander because he was the taller and more handsome of the two. [210] The Greek biographerPlutarch(c.45– c.120 AD) discusses the accuracy of his depictions: The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Lysippus made, and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled. [211] Historians have understood the detail of the pleasant fragrance attributed to Alexander as stemming from a belief in ancient Greece that pleasant scents are characteristic of gods and heroes. [205] TheAlexander Mosaicand contemporary coins portray Alexander with \"a straight nose, a slightly protruding jaw, full lips and eyes deep set beneath a strongly pronounced forehead\". [212] The ancient historianAelian(c.175–c.235 AD), in hisVaria Historia(12.14), describes Alexander's hair color as \"ξανθὴν\" (xanthín), which at the  time, could mean blond, tawny (yellowish brown) or reddish. [213][214][215]It is sometimes claimed that Alexander hadone blue and one brown eye,[216]referring to theAlexander Romance, which is however a fictional account that also claims Alexander \"had sharp teeth like fangs\" and \"did not look like Philip or Olympias\".\n",

      "Section Title: Personality\n",
      "Section Summary: His father Philip was probably Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds. [53]Alexander's relationship with his father \"forged\" the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to outdo his father, illustrated by his reckless behavior in battle. [220]While Alexander worried that his father would leave him \"no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world\",[221]he also downplayed his father's achievements to his companions. [220]Alexander's mother Olympia similarly had huge ambitions, and encouraged her son to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire. [220]She instilled a sense of destiny in him,[222]and Plutarch tells how his ambition \"kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years\". [223] According to Plutarch, Alexander also had a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature,[224]which could influence his decision making. [220]Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate. [226]This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn. [189][224]His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so. [229]Hisdelusions of grandeurare readily visible in hiswilland in his desire to conquer the world,[160]in as much as he is by various sources described as havingboundless ambition,[230][231]an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into a historical cliché. [235]Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notablyproskynesis, which was one aspect of Alexander's broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the Iranian upper classes;[106]however the practise ofproskynesiswas disapproved by the Macedonians, and they were unwilling to perform it. [236]Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in societies where the king was treated as divine.\n",

      "Section Title: Personal relationships\n",
      "Section Summary: Alexander married three times:Roxana, daughter of theSogdiannoblemanOxyartesofBactria,[239][240][241]out of love;[242]and the Persian princessesStateiraandParysatis, the former a daughter ofDarius IIIand the latter a daughter ofArtaxerxes III, for political reasons. [243][244]He apparently had two sons,Alexander IV of Macedonby Roxana and, possibly,Heracles of Macedonfrom his mistressBarsine. [149][248]This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detachedmental stateduring his final months.\n",

      "Section Title: Sexuality\n",
      "Section Summary: [249]The Roman era writerAthenaeussays, based on the scholarDicaearchus, who was Alexander's contemporary, that the king \"was quite excessively keen on boys\", and that Alexander kissed theeunuchBagoasin public. None of Alexander's contemporaries, however, are known to have explicitly described Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion as sexual, though the pair was often compared toAchilles and Patroclus, who are often interpreted as a couple. Aelian writes of Alexander's visit toTroywhere \"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles, and Hephaestion that ofPatroclus, the latter hinting that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles. \"[251]Some modern historians (e.g.,Robin Lane Fox) believe not only that Alexander's youthful relationship with Hephaestion was sexual, but also that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood, which went against the social norms of at least some Greek cities, such as Athens,[252][253]though some modern researchers have tentatively proposed that Macedonia (or at least the Macedonian court) may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults. [256] According to Diodorus Siculus, Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly, \"not wishing to offend the Macedonians\",[257]showing great self-control in \"pleasures of the body\". [258]Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, includingAda of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius's motherSisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.\n",

      "Section Summary: Alexander's legacy extended beyond his military conquests, and his reign marked a turning point in European and Asian history. [259]His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade betweenEastandWest, and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed toGreek civilizationand influence. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section Title: Hellenistic kingdoms\n",
      "Section Summary: At the time of his death, Alexander's empire covered some 5,200,000 km2(2,000,000 sq mi),[261]and was the largest state of its time. [189]However, the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history, theMaurya Empire. Taking advantage of this power vacuum,Chandragupta Maurya(referred to in Greek sources as \"Sandrokottos\"), of relatively humble origin, took control of thePunjab, and with that power base proceeded to conquer theNanda Empire.\n",

      "Section Title: Founding of cities\n",
      "Section Summary: [111][264]The first, and greatest, wasAlexandriain Egypt, which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities. [111]The cities' locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. [111]Following Alexander's death, many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece. [111][264]However, a century or so after Alexander's death, many of the Alexandrias were thriving, with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both Greek and local peoples.\n",

      "Section Title: Funding of temples\n",
      "Section Summary: In 334 BC, Alexander the Great donated funds for the completion of the new temple ofAthena PoliasinPriene, in modern-day western Turkey. [266]Aninscription from the temple, now housed in theBritish Museum, declares: \"King Alexander dedicated [this temple] to Athena Polias. \"[265]This inscription is one of the few independent archaeological discoveries confirming an episode from Alexander's life. [265][266][267] Libaniuswrote that Alexander founded the temple of Zeus Bottiaios (Ancient Greek:Βοττιαίου Δῖός), in the place where later the city ofAntiochwas built. [270] In 2023,British Museumexperts have suggested the possibility that a Greek temple atGirsuinIraq, was founded by Alexander.\n",

      "Section Title: Hellenization\n",
      "Section Summary: Hellenizationwas coined by the German historianJohann Gustav Droysento denote the spread of Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. [273]Alexander sought to insert Greek elements intoPersian cultureand to hybridize Greek and Persian culture, homogenizing the populations of Asia and Europe. [275]The close association of men from across Greece in Alexander's army directly led to the emergence of the largelyAttic-based \"koine\", or \"common\" Greek dialect. [276]Koine spread throughout the Hellenistic world, becoming thelingua francaof Hellenistic lands, and eventually the ancestor ofmodern Greek. [276]Furthermore,town planning, education, local government, and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals, evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section Title: Hellenization in South and Central Asia\n",
      "Section Summary: Some of the most pronounced effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-risingGreco-Bactrian Kingdom(250–125 BC) (in modernAfghanistan,Pakistan, andTajikistan) and theIndo-Greek Kingdom(180 BC – 10 AD) in modern Afghanistan and India. The cosmopolitan art and mythology ofGandhara(a region spanning the upper confluence of the Indus, Swat and Kabul rivers in modern Pakistan) of the ~3rd century BC to the ~5th century AD are most evident of the direct contact between Hellenistic civilization and South Asia, as are theEdicts of Ashoka, which directly mention the Greeks within Ashoka's dominion as converting to Buddhism and the reception of Buddhist emissaries by Ashoka's contemporaries in the Hellenistic world. [281]Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by theancient Greek religion: the concept ofBoddhisatvasis reminiscent of Greek divine heroes,[282]and someMahayanaceremonial practices(burningincense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practised by the ancient Greeks; however, similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture. [283]For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in theGreco-Bactriancity ofAi Khanoumin modern-dayAfghanistan,[284]while the Greek concept of aspherical Earthsurrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru) like the petals of a flower.[283][285][286]TheYavanajataka(lit. Greek astronomical treatise) andPaulisa Siddhantatexts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy.\n",

      "Section Title: Influence on Rome\n",
      "Section Summary: [288]Polybiusbegan hisHistoriesby reminding Romans of Alexander's achievements, and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model.Pompey the Greatadopted the epithet \"Magnus\" and even Alexander's anastole-type haircut, and searched the conquered lands of the east for Alexander's 260-year-old cloak, which he then wore as a sign of greatness. [288]Julius Caesardedicated aLysippeanequestrianbronzestatue, but replaced Alexander's head with his own, whileOctavianvisited Alexander's tomb in Alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from asphinxto Alexander's profile. [288]The Macriani, a Roman family that in the person ofMacrinusbriefly ascended to the imperial throne, kept images of Alexander on their persons, either on jewellery or embroidered into their clothes. [290] Emperor Julianin his satire called \"The Caesars\", describes a contest between the previous Roman emperors, with Alexander the Great called in as an extra contestant, in the presence of the assembled gods. [291] TheItinerarium Alexandriis a 4th-century Latin description of Alexander the Great's campaigns.Julius Caesarwent to serve his quaestorship in Hispania after his wife's funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC. While there, he encountered a statue of Alexander the Great, and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now at an age when Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little. [297] Caracalla's mania for Alexander went so far that Caracalla visited Alexandria while preparing for his Persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of theAristotelianschool based on a legend thatAristotlehad poisoned Alexander. [299] The diffusion of Greek culture and language cemented by Alexander's conquests in West Asia and North Africa served as a \"precondition\" for thelater Roman expansioninto these territories andentire basisfor theByzantine Empire, according toErrington.\n",

      "Section Title: Letters\n",
      "Section Summary: A few official letters addressed to the Greek cities survive in copies inscribed in stone and the content of others is sometimes reported in historical sources. Several fictitious letters, some perhaps based on actual letters, made their way into theRomancetradition.\n",

      "Section Title: In legend\n",
      "Section Summary: Writing shortly after Alexander's death,Onesicritusinvented a tryst between Alexander andThalestris, queen of the mythicalAmazons. He reportedly read this passage to his patron KingLysimachus, who had been one of Alexander's generals and who quipped, \"I wonder where I was at the time. \"[304] In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in Alexandria, a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as theAlexander Romance, later falsely ascribed to Callisthenes and therefore known asPseudo-Callisthenes. This text underwent over one hundred recensions, translations, and derivations throughout the Islamic and European worlds in premodern times,[305]containing many dubious stories,[303]and was translated into twenty-five languages,[306]for exampleMiddle Persian,SyriacandArabic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section Title: In ancient and modern culture\n",
      "Section Summary: TheAlexander Romance, in particular, has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures, from Persian to medieval European, to modern Greek. [308]The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek (\"O Megalexandros\") is a household name, and he is the only ancient hero to appear in theKaragiozisshadow play. [308]One well-known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitarymermaidwho would grasp a ship's prow during a storm and ask the captain, \"Is King Alexander alive?\" [308] In pre-IslamicMiddle Persian(Zoroastrian) literature, Alexander is referred to by the epithetgujastak, meaning \"accursed\", and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism. [310]Firdausi'sShahnameh(\"The Book of Kings\")includes Alexanderin a line of legitimate Persianshahs, a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of theFountain of Youth. \"The Two-Horned One\") is believed by the majority of modern researchers of theQur'anas well as Islamic commentators to be a reference to Alexander. [315]His defeat of Darius was depicted as Egypt's salvation, \"proving\" Egypt was still ruled by an Egyptian. [310] According toJosephus, Alexander was shown theBook of Danielwhen he entered Jerusalem, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. [316] InHindiandUrdu, the name \"Sikandar\", derived from the Persian name for Alexander, denotes a rising young talent, and theDelhi SultanaterulerAlauddin Khaljistylized himself as \"Sikandar-i-Sani\" (the Second Alexander the Great). [317]Inmedieval India, Turkic and Afghan sovereigns from the Iranian-cultured region of Central Asia brought positive cultural connotations of Alexander to the Indian subcontinent, resulting in the efflorescence ofSikandernameh(Alexander Romances) written by Indo-Persian poets such asAmir Khusrauand the prominence of Alexander the Great as a popular subject in Mughal-era Persian miniatures. [319]During the firstItalian campaign of the French Revolutionary Wars, in a question fromBourrienne, asking whether he gave his preference to Alexander or Caesar,Napoleonsaid that he places Alexander The Great in the first rank, the main reason being his campaign on Asia. Newer novels about Alexander are:\n",
      "The trilogy \"Alexander the Great\" byValerio Massimo Manfrediconsisting of \"The son of the dream\", \"The sand of Amon\", and \"The ends of the world\". The trilogy ofMary Renaultconsisting of \"Fire from Heaven\", \"The Persian Boy\" and \"Funeral Games\".\n",

      "Section Summary: Alexander III of Macedon(Ancient Greek:Ἀλέξανδρος,romanized:Alexandros; 20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC), most commonly known asAlexander the Great,[c]was a king of theancient Greekkingdom ofMacedon. [d]He succeeded his fatherPhilip IIto the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20 and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthymilitary campaignthroughoutWestern Asia,Central Asia, parts ofSouth Asia, andEgypt. In 335 BC, shortly after his assumption of kingship over Macedon, hecampaigned in the Balkansand reasserted control overThraceand parts ofIllyriabefore marching on the city ofThebes, which wassubsequently destroyed in battle. Following his conquest ofAsia Minor, Alexander broke the power of Achaemenid Persia in a series of decisive battles, including those atIssusandGaugamela; he subsequently overthrewDarius IIIand conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. Alexander endeavored to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" andinvaded Indiain 326 BC, achieving an important victory overPorus, an ancient Indian king of present-dayPunjab, at theBattle of the Hydaspes. Due to the demand of his homesick troops, he eventually turned back at theBeas Riverand later died in 323 BC inBabylon, the city ofMesopotamiathat he had planned to establish as his empire's capital.Alexander's deathleft unexecuted an additional series of planned military and mercantile campaigns that would have begun with a Greek invasion ofArabia. With his death marking the start of theHellenistic period, Alexander's legacy includes thecultural diffusionandsyncretismthat his conquests engendered, such asGreco-BuddhismandHellenistic Judaism.He founded more than twenty cities, with the most prominent being the city ofAlexandriain Egypt. Alexander's settlement ofGreek colonistsand the resulting spread ofGreek cultureled to the overwhelming dominance ofHellenistic civilizationand influence as far east as theIndian subcontinent. His military achievements and unprecedented enduring successes in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselves,[f]and his tactics remain a significant subject of study inmilitary academiesworldwide. [7]Legends of Alexander's exploits coalesced into the third-centuryAlexander Romancewhich, in the premodern period, went through over one hundred recensions, translations, and derivations and was translated into almost every European vernacular and every language of the Islamic world.\n",

      "Section Summary: Alexander III was born inPella, the capital of theKingdom of Macedon,[10]on the sixth day of theancient Greek monthofHekatombaion, which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC (although the exact date is uncertain). [11][12]He was the son of the erstwhile king of Macedon,Philip II, and his fourth wife,Olympias(daughter ofNeoptolemus I, king ofEpirus). [13][g]Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander. [14] Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood. [15]According to theancient GreekbiographerPlutarch, on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread \"far and wide\" before dying away. Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with asealengraved with a lion's image. [16]Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father wasZeus. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious. [16] On the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing asiegeon the city ofPotideaon the peninsula ofChalcidice. [15] In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse,Lanike, sister of Alexander's future generalCleitus the Black. [19]When Alexander was ten years old, a trader fromThessalybrought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteentalents. Alexander, however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to tame the horse, which he eventually managed. [15]Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring: \"My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. When the animal died (because of old age, according to Plutarch, at age 30), Alexander named a city after him,Bucephala.\n",

      "Section Summary: When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for atutor, and considered such academics asIsocratesandSpeusippus, the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of theAcademyto take up the post. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown ofStageira, which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works ofHomer, and in particular theIliad; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns. [24] In his youth, Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court, who received the protection of Philip II for several years as they opposedArtaxerxes III. [25][26][27]Among them wereArtabazos IIand his daughterBarsine, possible future mistress of Alexander, who resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC, as well asAmminapes, futuresatrapof Alexander, or a Persian nobleman namedSisines. [25][28][29][30]This gave the Macedonian court a good knowledge of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the Macedonian state.

      "Section Summary: Philip II had waged war against theThraciansto the north, which left Alexander in charge asregentandheir apparent. [15]During Philip's absence, the Thracian tribe ofMaedirevolted against Macedonia. [32] Upon Philip's return, Alexander was dispatched with a small force to subdue the revolts in southernThrace. Campaigning against the Greek city ofPerinthus, Alexander reportedly saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city ofAmphissabegan to work lands that were sacred toApollonearDelphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. While Philip was occupied in Thrace, Alexander was ordered to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. [33] Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south throughThermopylae, taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes's favour, but Athens won the contest. [34]Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on the request of theAmphictyonic League), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it. During the ensuingBattle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenianhoplitesto follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. [36] After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, devastating much of Laconia and ejecting the Spartans from various parts of it. [37]AtCorinth, Philip established a \"Hellenic Alliance\" (modelled on the oldanti-Persian allianceof theGreco-Persian Wars), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then namedHegemon(often translated as \"Supreme Commander\") of this league (known by modern scholars as theLeague of Corinth), and announced his plans to attack thePersian Empire.\n",

      "Section Summary: [41]The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half-Macedonian. [41] At the wedding of Cleopatra, whom Philip fell in love with and married, she being much too young for him, her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece. This so irritated Alexander that throwing one of the cups at his head, \"You villain,\" said he, \"what, am I then a bastard?\" Then Philip, taking Attalus's part, rose up and would have run his son through; but by good fortune for them both, either his over-hasty rage, or the wine he had drunk, made his foot slip, so that he fell down on the floor, at which Alexander reproachfully insulted him: \"See there,\" said he, \"the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, overturned in passing from one seat to another.\" [46] In the following year, the Persiansatrap(governor) ofCaria,Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother,Philip Arrhidaeus. [44]Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. [44]Alexander reacted by sending an actor,Thessalusof Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. [44]Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends,Harpalus,Nearchus,PtolemyandErigyius, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.\n",

Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus,[53]who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to be left alive. [54]Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. [56] Alexander stopped at Thermopylae where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south toCorinth. The famousencounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynicoccurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him, the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the sunlight. [57]This reply apparently delighted Alexander who is reported to have said, \"But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes. \"[58]At Corinth, Alexander took the title ofHegemon(\"leader\") and, like Philip, was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia.\n",

During his brief months in Egypt, he reformed the taxation system on the Greek models and organized the military occupation of the country, but in early 331 BC he left for Asia in pursuit of the Persians. [81] Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC where he was regarded as a liberator. [82]To legitimize taking power and be recognized as the descendant of the long line of pharaohs, Alexander made sacrifices to the gods at Memphis and went to consult the famous oracle of Amun-Ra at theSiwa Oasisin theLibyandesert,[81]at which he was pronounced the son of the deityAmun.

[102]Alexander buried Darius's remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. [105]However, as basic forms of community life and the general structure of government were maintained and resuscitated by Alexander under his own rule, he, in the words of theIranologistPierre Briant\"may therefore be considered to have acted in many ways as thelast of the Achaemenids. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modernKandaharin Afghanistan, andAlexandria Eschate(\"The Furthest\") in modernTajikistan. The campaign took Alexander throughMedia,Parthia,Aria(West Afghanistan),Drangiana,Arachosia(South and Central Afghanistan),Bactria(North and Central Afghanistan), andScythia.

[106]The Greeks however regarded the gesture ofproskynesisas the province ofdeitiesand believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. [106]This created a problem for Alexander as to whether he had to make use of the various segments and people that had given the empire its solidity and unity for a lengthy period of time. [106]Pierre Briantexplains that Alexander realized that it was insufficient to merely exploit the internal contradictions within the imperial system as in Asia Minor, Babylonia or Egypt; he also had to (re)create a central government with or without the support of the Iranians. [106]As early as 334 BC he demonstrated awareness of this, when he challenged incumbent King Darius III \"by appropriating the main elements of the Achaemenid monarchy's ideology, particularly the theme of the king who protects the lands and the peasants\". [106]Alexander wrote a letter in 332 BC to Darius III, wherein he argued that he was worthier than Darius \"to succeed to the Achaemenid throne\". [106]However, Alexander's eventual decision to burn the Achaemenid palace atPersepolisin conjunction with the major rejection and opposition of the \"entire Persian people\" made it impracticable for him to pose himself as Darius' legitimate successor. [106]Against Bessus (Artaxerxes V) however, Briant adds, Alexander reasserted \"his claim to legitimacy as the avenger of Darius III\". [106] A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers,Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus,Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation atMaracanda(modern daySamarkandinUzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and especially of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.\n",

[122]The silver coinage had a beardless head ofHeracleswearing a lionskin headdress on the obverse and Zeus aetophoros ('eagle bearer') enthroned with a scepter in his left hand, on the reverse. Heracles andZeuswere important deities for the Macedonians, with Heracles considered to be the ancestor of the Temenid dynasty and Zeus the patron of the main Macedonian sanctuary,Dium.

Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 talents in gold\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends atHund,[126]supplied their troops with provisions, and he received Alexander and his whole army in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. Subsequently, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; Taxiles contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes and was entrusted by Alexander with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death ofPhilip, son of Machatas, and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces atTriparadisus, 321 BC.

[138] Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther, but his generalCoenuspleaded with him to change his opinion and return; the men, he said, \"longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland\". Along the way his army conquered theMalhi(in modern-dayMultan) and other Indian tribes; while besieging the Mallian citadel, Alexander suffered a near-fatal injury when an arrow penetrated his armor and entered his lung. [139][140] Alexander sent much of his army toCarmania(modern southernIran) with generalCraterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore thePersian Gulfshore under his admiralNearchus, while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along theGedrosian DesertandMakran.\n",

They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units. [145] After three days, unable to persuade his men to back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts in the army and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units. [146]In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexanderheld a mass marriageof his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year. [144] Meanwhile, upon his return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of thetomb of Cyrus the GreatinPasargadaehad desecrated it, and swiftly executed them. [147]Alexander admiredCyrus the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon'sCyropaedia, which described Cyrus's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator. [148]During his visit to Pasargadae, Alexander ordered his architectAristobulusto decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus's tomb.

      "Section Title: Death and succession\n",
      "Section Summary: [151][152]There are two different versions of Alexander's death, differing slightly in details. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiralNearchusand spent the night and next day drinking withMedius of Larissa. [154]In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever, instead dying after some agony. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian andJustinall mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication,[157]while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness. [159]Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence[160]and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas,[161]Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. [162]However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander. [163][164][165]In a 2014 manuscript in the journalClinical Toxicology, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked withVeratrum album, and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in theAlexander Romance. [166]Veratrum albumpoisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned,Veratrum albumoffers the most plausible cause. [166][167]Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (modern-dayMavroneriin Arcadia, Greece) that containedcalicheamicin, a dangerous compound produced by bacteria. [173]Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.\n",

[174][175]According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\". [177] While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. [174][176]His successor,Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at leastlate antiquity.Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. [178]The 2014 discovery of anenormous tombin northern Greece, atAmphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great[179]has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. [180][181] Pompey,Julius CaesarandAugustusall visited the tomb in Alexandria where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off.Caligulawas said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. [178] The so-called \"Alexander Sarcophagus\", discovered nearSidonand now in theIstanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because itsbas-reliefsdepict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. [185][186][187]In addition, Leosthenes also likened the anarchy between the generals, after Alexander's death, to the blinded Cyclops \"who after he had lost his eye went feeling and groping about with his hands before him, not knowing where to lay them\".\n",

[189]According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was \"tôi kratistôi\"—\"to the strongest\". [155]Another theory is that his successors wilfully or erroneously misheard \"tôi Kraterôi\"—\"to Craterus\", the general leading his Macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of Macedonia. [191]Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed hissignet ringtoPerdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him. [155][189] Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male, with himself,Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between \"The Successors\" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into three stable power blocs:Ptolemaic Egypt,Seleucid Syria and East, andAntigonid Macedonia.\n",

[194]Furthermore,Perdiccashad read the notebooks containing Alexander's last plans to the Macedonian troops in Babylon, who voted not to carry them out. [65] According to Diodorus, Alexander's last plans called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean, monumental constructions, and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations. It included: The enormous scale of these plans has led many scholars to doubt their historicity.Ernst Badianargued that they were exaggerated by Perdiccas in order to ensure that the Macedonian troops voted not to carry them out.\n",

      "Section Summary: Alexander perhaps earned the epithet \"the Great\" due to his unparalleled success as a military commander; he never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered. [199]TheMacedonian phalanx, armed with thesarissa, a spear 6 metres (20 ft) long, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and manoeuvrability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces. [199] In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. [201]Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about 3 km (1.86 mi). [202] At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. [203]At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. [202] When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, inBactriaandSogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center. [203]In India, confronted by Porus's elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.\n",

      "Section Title: Physical appearance\n",
      "Section Summary: [205]Ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image; scholars today, however, find the claim dubious. [206][205]Nevertheless, Andrew Stewart highlights the fact that artistic portraits, not least because of who they are commissioned by, are always partisan, and that artistic portrayals of Alexander \"seek to legitimize him (or, by extension, his Successors), to interpret him to their audiences, to answer their critiques, and to persuade them of his greatness\", and thus should be considered within a framework of \"praise and blame\", in the same way sources such as praise poetry are. [208] Curtius Rufus, a Roman historian from the first century AD, who wrote theHistories of Alexander the Great, gives this account of Alexander sitting on the throne ofDarius III: Then Alexander seating himself on the royal throne, which was far too high for his bodily stature. [209] Both Curtius andDiodorusreport a story that whenDarius III's mother,Sisygambis, first met Alexander andHephaestion, she assumed that the latter was Alexander because he was the taller and more handsome of the two. [210] The Greek biographerPlutarch(c.45– c.120 AD) discusses the accuracy of his depictions: The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Lysippus made, and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled. [211] Historians have understood the detail of the pleasant fragrance attributed to Alexander as stemming from a belief in ancient Greece that pleasant scents are characteristic of gods and heroes. [205] TheAlexander Mosaicand contemporary coins portray Alexander with \"a straight nose, a slightly protruding jaw, full lips and eyes deep set beneath a strongly pronounced forehead\". [212] The ancient historianAelian(c.175–c.235 AD), in hisVaria Historia(12.14), describes Alexander's hair color as \"ξανθὴν\" (xanthín), which at the  time, could mean blond, tawny (yellowish brown) or reddish. [213][214][215]It is sometimes claimed that Alexander hadone blue and one brown eye,[216]referring to theAlexander Romance, which is however a fictional account that also claims Alexander \"had sharp teeth like fangs\" and \"did not look like Philip or Olympias\".\n",

      "Section Title: Personality\n",
      "Section Summary: His father Philip was probably Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds. [53]Alexander's relationship with his father \"forged\" the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to outdo his father, illustrated by his reckless behavior in battle. [220]While Alexander worried that his father would leave him \"no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world\",[221]he also downplayed his father's achievements to his companions. [220]Alexander's mother Olympia similarly had huge ambitions, and encouraged her son to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire. [220]She instilled a sense of destiny in him,[222]and Plutarch tells how his ambition \"kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years\". [223] According to Plutarch, Alexander also had a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature,[224]which could influence his decision making. [220]Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate. [226]This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn. [189][224]His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so. [229]Hisdelusions of grandeurare readily visible in hiswilland in his desire to conquer the world,[160]in as much as he is by various sources described as havingboundless ambition,[230][231]an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into a historical cliché. [235]Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notablyproskynesis, which was one aspect of Alexander's broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the Iranian upper classes;[106]however the practise ofproskynesiswas disapproved by the Macedonians, and they were unwilling to perform it. [236]Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in societies where the king was treated as divine.\n",

None of Alexander's contemporaries, however, are known to have explicitly described Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion as sexual, though the pair was often compared toAchilles and Patroclus, who are often interpreted as a couple. Aelian writes of Alexander's visit toTroywhere \"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles, and Hephaestion that ofPatroclus, the latter hinting that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles. \"[251]Some modern historians (e.g.,Robin Lane Fox) believe not only that Alexander's youthful relationship with Hephaestion was sexual, but also that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood, which went against the social norms of at least some Greek cities, such as Athens,[252][253]though some modern researchers have tentatively proposed that Macedonia (or at least the Macedonian court) may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults. [256] According to Diodorus Siculus, Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly, \"not wishing to offend the Macedonians\",[257]showing great self-control in \"pleasures of the body\". [258]Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, includingAda of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius's motherSisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.\n",

[275]The close association of men from across Greece in Alexander's army directly led to the emergence of the largelyAttic-based \"koine\", or \"common\" Greek dialect. [276]Koine spread throughout the Hellenistic world, becoming thelingua francaof Hellenistic lands, and eventually the ancestor ofmodern Greek.

The cosmopolitan art and mythology ofGandhara(a region spanning the upper confluence of the Indus, Swat and Kabul rivers in modern Pakistan) of the ~3rd century BC to the ~5th century AD are most evident of the direct contact between Hellenistic civilization and South Asia, as are theEdicts of Ashoka, which directly mention the Greeks within Ashoka's dominion as converting to Buddhism and the reception of Buddhist emissaries by Ashoka's contemporaries in the Hellenistic world. [281]Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by theancient Greek religion: the concept ofBoddhisatvasis reminiscent of Greek divine heroes,[282]and someMahayanaceremonial practices(burningincense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practised by the ancient Greeks; however, similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture. [283]For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in theGreco-Bactriancity ofAi Khanoumin modern-dayAfghanistan,[284]while the Greek concept of aspherical Earthsurrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru) like the petals of a flower.[283][285][286]TheYavanajataka(lit.
